	1) I'd divide the figures by the relevant state population to get a mean per capita search volume if I wanted to use search volume to answer the question.
	However the data seems to exist -> Passport Issuance and Application Data -> https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/about-us/reports-and-statistics.html
	So I'd use the issuance per state number and divide by state population to get a mean per capita issuance. I'd use the total application figures and subtract the 
	sum of the issuance figures to see what percentage of applications result in an issued passport to establish uncertainties in the data since issuance isn't strictly applications.
	Applications > Issuance but if e.g 99.9% of applications are successful then it'd be a useful proxy, if only 5% of applications aren't successful it might not be depending on how
	heterogenous application behaviour is by state. 											
													
	2)	Estimate the median age of people who live in Oxford? - provide reasoning/sources	
	2) 	https://www.oxford.gov.uk/population-statistics/age-gender-statistics -> It's 31	
		However if the data did not exist I would assume the UK median age for Oxfords population minus the student figures for Oxfords Universities where I would assume a median of 22 since that 
		strikes a balance between people starting university and masters/phd students. If I could get a better breakdown of figures for university then I could make a better estimate. 
		Oxford Population = 152450
		Oxford Student population = 34945
		Median UK Age = 40.7 ~ 41
		Median Student Age(estimated) = 22
		Estimated Median Age = (34945*20 + (152450-34945)*41)/152450 = 36.6 Years 
		This indicates that the rest of Oxfords population also skews younger than UK average which isn't entirely suprising. 
													
	3)	If a car travels to point A at 60mph and returns from point A to it's original position at 20mph, what is the average speed of the car?		
		x, where x is the starting point
		A, where A is the destination
		Delta T, where T is the total time to travel there and back. 	
		Speed = Change in Distance / Change in Time => ((A-x) + (A-x))/DeltaT # Since we're travelling back and forth
		(1) DeltaT = (2(A-x))/Speed 
		Since Speed is two values Delta T is also equal to the sum of the distance divided by each speed
		DeltaT = (A-x)/Speed1 + (A-x)/Speed2
		(2) DeltaT = (A-x)/60 + (A-x)/20 = (A-x)/60 + (3*(A-x))/(3*20) = (4*(A-x))/60 = (A-x)/15
		
		(1) and (2) are both DeltaT so we can set them equal to get the average speed
		
		(2(A-x))/AverageSpeed = (A-x)/15 
		2/AverageSpeed = 1/15 
		AverageSpeed = 30mph
									
													
	4)	Use Booking.com or similar source to scrape US hotel prices to determine and rank which US States have the cheapest winter hotels.
